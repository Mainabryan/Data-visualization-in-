# Overview
This project presents a comprehensive visual analysis of global earthquake data using Tableau Public. The objective is to answer key questions related to earthquake magnitude, impact, and geographic distribution. The following README outlines the projectâ€™s goals, visual solutions, insights, and final deliverables.

# Objectives
Load the earthquake dataset from the provided CSV file into Tableau Public.

Create compelling visuals to analyze trends and patterns in the dataset.

Answer key business and analytical questions through meaningful charts and dashboards.

# Business Questions & Visual Solutions
1. How many earthquakes had resulted in a tsunami?
Visual Used: Pie Chart

Goal: Highlight the proportion of earthquakes that caused tsunamis versus those that did not.

2. What is the global distribution of earthquake magnitudes?
Visual Used: Map Chart

Goal: Showcase earthquake magnitudes around the world by geographic location.

3. How did earthquake magnitudes fluctuate in Peru and Russia?
Visual Used: Line Chart or Bar Chart (depending on data size and granularity)

Goal: Compare magnitude variations over time between the two countries.

4. What is the relationship between earthquake magnitude and significance level?
Visual Used: Scatter Plot

Goal: Examine if higher magnitudes correlate with higher significance levels.

Insight: Interpretation of this chart reveals the strength of correlation between these variables.

5. What was the distribution of earthquake magnitudes in the year 2022?
Visual Used: Histogram or Box Plot

Goal: Display the frequency and spread of magnitudes during 2022.

Personalization & Enhancement
Titles and Labels: All visuals include clear titles and renamed axes to improve readability and interpretation.

Interactivity: Filters and tooltips were added where applicable to enhance user interaction.

Dashboard Creation
Dashboard: All charts are compiled into a single interactive dashboard.

Publication: The dashboard is saved and published to the user's Tableau Public account for public access and sharing.
